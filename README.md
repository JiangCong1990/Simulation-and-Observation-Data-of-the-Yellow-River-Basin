# Simulation-and-Observation-Data-of-the-Yellow-River-Basin
Within this folder, you'll find offline AHMS-IRRIG and AHMS-SED model input data and simulation results, and corresponding water and sediment discharge observation data.

We use the online AHMS-IRRIG and AHMS-SED to simulate the hydrligucail, irrgation and sediment processes in the Yellow River Basin from 1979 to 1987 at a 20 km resolution.
