# Simulation-and-Observation-Data-of-the-Yellow-River-Basin
Within this folder, you'll find both offline AHMS-IRRIG and AHMS-SED model input data and simulation results, and corresponding water and sediment discharge observation data.

This folder contains input data, simulation results, and corresponding observational data for water and sediment discharge in the Yellow River Basin. The data and results presented here support the simulation of hydrological, irrigation, and sediment processes using the AHMS-IRRIG and AHMS-SED models.

# Overview
We employed the online AHMS-IRRIG and AHMS-SED models to simulate the hydrological, irrigation, and sediment dynamics in the Yellow River Basin from 1979 to 1987 at a spatial resolution of 20 km. These models integrate advanced hydrological and sediment transport processes to provide detailed insights into the region’s water and sediment balance.

JAMES_Figures/: Includes visual representations, such as sediment transport plots, generated for the JAMES submission.
OUTPUT_DATA/: Contains the output files from the AHMS-SED model, including sediment simulation results.
Data Description
Observation Data: Includes water and sediment discharge measurements from observation stations in the Yellow River Basin. These data are used to evaluate the model performance and ensure the accuracy of the simulation results.
Simulation Results: Provide detailed outputs for hydrological processes, irrigation activities, and sediment transport for the study period (1979–1987).

# Notes
The Noah-MP and HMS models are foundational components of the AHMS-IRRIG and AHMS-SED systems.
The 20 km spatial resolution ensures a balance between computational efficiency and spatial detail.
The figures in the JAMES_Figures/ folder are prepared for submission to JAMES, illustrating key findings and model validation results.
